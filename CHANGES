Version 2.2.5 (16-sep-2010)
---------------------------

Fix Y2K issue with Last Update field in the header (sf bug 3065838).

Version 2.2.4 (26-may-2009)
---------------------------

Ignore leading and trailing zero bytes in numeric fields.

Version 2.2.3 (17-feb-2009)
---------------------------

Support for writing empty date values.

Version 2.2.2 (16-sep-2008)
---------------------------

Numeric decoder returns float when the value contains decimal point
without regard to the number of decimal places declared in the header.

Version 2.2.1 (16-mar-2008)
---------------------------

Fix: raise ValueError if a name passed to field constructor
is longer than 10 characters.

Version 2.2.0 (11-feb-2007)
---------------------------

Features:
  - date fields are allowed to contain values stored with leading spaces
    instead of leading zeroes.
  - dbf.header returns field definition objects if accessed as a list
    or as a dictionary.
  - added raw data access methods: DbfRecord.rawFromStream(),
    DbfFieldDef.rawFromRecord().
  - added conversion error handling: if ignoreErrors=True is passed
    with Dbf constructor arguments, then failing field value conversions
    will not raise errors but instead will return special object
    INVALID_VALUE which is equal to None, empty string and zero.
    .ignoreErrors property of the Dbf instances may be toggled also
    after instance initialization.

Version 2.1.0 (01-dec-2006)
---------------------------

Features:
  - support field types 'F' (float), 'I' (integer) and 'Y' (currency)

Fix processing of empty Timestamp values

Version 2.0.3 (30-oct-2006)
---------------------------

Fixes:
  - compatibility fix for Python versions prior to 2.4 (sf bug 1574526)
  - wrong record length when reading from file object (sf bug 1586619)

Version 2.0.2 (08-jul-2006)
---------------------------

Fix dbfnew (legacy API for DBF creation)

Version 2.0.1 (10-mar-2006)
---------------------------

Fixes in Numeric field processing:
  - decoding inserted decimal point where it shouldn't;
  - encoded value never exceeds field length.
    If encoded value is too large for the field, decimal digits get
    removed (rounding the value down).  When integer value is larger
    than the field length, ValueError is raised.

Fix: Date and Logical fields were not able to decode empty values.

Errors raised from field processing include field name.

Version 2.0.0 (20-dec-2005)
---------------------------

Changed style of doc-strings; added more docs.

``mx.DateTime`` isn't required anymore - internal representation uses
``datetime.date`` and ``datetime.datetime`` classes from the batteries.

'D' and 'T' became "smarter":
  - date fields could accept:
    - date/time tuples [or tuples with at least
      first three components (year, day, month)];
    - strings in format 'yyyymmdd' or 'yymmdd';
    - ``datetime.date`` and ``datetime.datetime`` instances;
    - ``None`` instance - use current date value;
    - numbers (``int``, ``long``, ``float``)
      which are treated as seconds from epoch;
    - objects having 'ticks' method (``mx.DateTime`` for example);
  - datetime fields can accept everything date fields do
    except string objects (which is a TODO stuff).

Changed identifiers and args of some methods. For example old code

         dbf = Dbf()
         dbf.openFile("county.dbf", readOnly=1)

now should be written like

         dbf = Dbf("county.dbf", True)

All classes now are new-style classes (inherited from the ``object``).

Got rid of ``binnum`` and ``strutil`` modules,
using ``struct`` and string methods instead.

Group classes in different modules instead of having them all in
one, as it was earlier (see dbf.py from the previous release(s)).

Use fields' registry to simplify registering of the new data types.
